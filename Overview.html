			<h2 id="intro" class="no-display">Introduction</h2>
			<p>The accessibility of websites and online services benefits most when it is considered throughout the whole project process. As with other important aspects of website development, such as security or maintainability, accessibility is best approached as an aspect of good practice and as an ongoing activity.</p>
			<h3>What is this document for?</h3>
				<p>This document provides you with guidance and considerations on how to approach planning for accessibility. You may be planning to create a new website, have already begun the process and now need to consider accessibility, or looking to improve your organizational processes and policies.</p>
			<h3>Who is it for?</h3>
				<p>This document is for project managers, project team leaders, and small business owners. You may have internal teams or be outsourcing some or all of the project. It is also useful for accessibility consultants who are engaged in supporting a project or broader organizational change.</p>
			<h3>How to use this document</h3>
				<p>There are many planning approaches and many factors will impact on what is feasible or sensible in your project. The best way to use this document is to skim the sections and find what you will work well for your project depending on where you are and what you are seeking to achieve. The <strong>Key Actions</strong> provides an indication of what to consider, why this is important, and some helpful activities or questions.</p>

			<h2 id="goal">Determine Your Goal and Gather Support</h2>
			<p>Whether your accessibility goals are confined to a single project or are aimed a widespread organizational change, you will need to ensure that you have suitable backing and support. A clear and realistic accessibility goal is easy to communicate, aids in overall planning, and is recognizable when successfully achieved.</p>

			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul class="key-actions">
				<li><span class="f_panelHead">Identify and document the project accessibility goals.</span>
					<div>
						<p>Defining accessibility goals clarifies what activities need planned, how support can be best achieved, and what deliverables are required. Some example goals are; ensure that the new company website is accessible, or improve the integration of accessibility into organizational development processes and policies.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li><span class="f_panelHead">Explore your organization's current approach, understanding, and view of accessibility.</span>
					<div>
						<p>How your organization currently understands and views accessibility will help refine how goals can be realistically achieved. This may require a review of any existing policies or process, as well as exploring the issue with key members of staff. As well as helping refine your goals, this should also highlight what activities might be beneficial in promoting those goals and gathering internal support.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li><span class="f_panelHead">Identify the key reasons for accessibility and, if needed, develop a business case.</span>
					<div>
						<p>Understanding why accessibility has become important will help preparing materials to persuade others and in resolving resource prioritization clashes. A business case focused on key reasons may be required as part of this process. Key reasons may also suggest additional necessary activities. For example, an executive directive to increase revenue by growing the website's reach to include people with disabilities, older people, and mobile web users will likely require more robust reporting of accessibility achievements and impact on revenue.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li><span class="f_panelHead">Promote awareness within your organization, and seek interested peers.</span>
					<div>
						<p>Other project teams with a stake or role in your organization's online presence may need to be persuaded of the value of accessibility. Individuals in these teams may also be able to take on some accessibility responsibility or be helpful in adding additional influence for the project goals.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li><span class="f_panelHead">Secure commitment and backing, ideally from the executive and project management level.</span>
					<div>
						<p>Any prepared business case can be used to obtain commitment to project goals, ideally by more senior management. This will simplify many issues down the line, especially when there are clashes in project or organizational priorities. Where you have limited influence within your organization, this backing will be invaluable.</p>
					</div>

			</ul>

			<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>		


			<h2 id="resp">Establish Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
			<p>Identify and appoint individuals who are responsible for accessibility within your project team or organization, and outline what that role entails.</p>
		
			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify roles and assign responsibilities across different areas of the project.</li>
				<li>Consider what organizational areas might impact on the provision of accessible online services and websites, and ensure they are aware of their role and responsibilities.</li>
				<li>Communicate within the project and organization who the responsible parties are.</li>
				<li>When using an external organization, ensure they are aware of your accessibility requirements and of their responsibilities.</li>
				<li>For websites and projects spanning jurisdictional regions, ensure responsibility is assigned for each region.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="f_panelHead">More detail</h3>
			<div>
				<div class="">
					<p>Identifying and appointing individuals responsible for accessibility ensure that any accessibility related issues are not neglected and that everyone on the team, and in your organization, knows where to take accessibility questions.</p>
					<p class="eg">
						e.g.
					</p>
					<div class="example-bar">
					<h4>Example responsibilities</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Marketing</b> - Ensuring good accessibility practice within the brand or design guidelines.</li>
							<li><b>Development</b> - Maintain code libraries with accessible components.</li>
							<li><b>Purchasing</b> - Ensure that organizational accessibility policy is incorporated within procurement processes.</li>
							<li><b>Acceptance testing</b> - Ensure that any agency delivered website or component meets your desired level of accessibility.</li>
							<li><b>Recruitment</b> - Incorporate accessibility skills within recruitment profiles.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p>Responsibility may be spread throughout your project team, particularly in larger teams. For example, the responsibility for ensuring accessible visual design may be shared by the design manager and digital designer. In other situations, one individual may have multiple responsibilities. For example, in a smaller team a developer may be responsible for the coding as well as for the quality assurance testing. What is important, is to identify responsibilities and assign them to appropriate individuals.</p>
					<p>While some roles and responsibilities are focused on the immediate project needs, others are focused on ensuring sustainability of frameworks that facilitate accessibility. For example, part of the responsibility of the role for 'accessible design' would be to ensure that members of the design team have the appropriate skills and knowledge to deliver accessible designs. Other areas that you may also need to consider include human resources, procurement, marketing, organizational executive, and legal. Identified responsible parties in these areas have the task of incorporating accessibility into existing policies, practices, and procedures.</p>

			<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>


			<h2 id="policy">Develop and Implement Organizational Policy</h2>
			<p>Develop and maintain a policy that states your organization's commitment to web accessibility, and ensure that it is adhered to throughout the project and across the organization.</p>

			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify any existing policies related to accessibility.</li>
				<li>Establish a policy stating your organization's commitment to web accessibility.</li>
				<li>Communicate and promote the policy across relevant parts of the organization.</li>
				<li>Review related policies and procedures to incorporate the accessibility policy throughout.</li>
				<li>Announce your organizational commitments publicly for accountability.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="f_panelHead">More detail</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Your organizational policy captures and communicates your intentions to provide accessible websites and services. Establishing an organizational policy for web accessibility is a critical milestone as it documents your organization's commitment to accessibility and helps set expectations for everyone involved.</p>
				<p>There may be existing policies and commitments relating to accessibility that you could build on. For example, there may be policies relating to work ethics, equal opportunities, diversity, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) that could be relevant.</p>
				<p>You can reflect the web accessibility policy in relevant policies to incorporate it throughout the organization's procedures and practices, and maximize its impact. For example, your procurement processes would outline how externally purchased websites or elements will meet your accessibility policy and what acceptance criteria are acceptable</p>
				<p>While the bulk of the web accessibility policy may be internal, it is often useful to outline your organization's commitments in a public policy to help set expectations of your website visitors and reaffirm public accountability internally.</p>

			</ul>

			<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>


			<h2 id="resource">Review Available Tools and Resources</h2>
			<p>Identify and review what internal design and development tools and resources are available, and how well they can support you in meeting your accessibility goals.</p>

			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify web authoring tools and review how well they support your accessibility goals.</li>
				<li>Review organizational and project specific design and development resources.</li>
				<li>Research lessons learned from the development of other websites within the organization.</li>
				<li>Explore examples of similar websites and organizations, and publicly documented solutions.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="f_panelHead">More detail</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Web authoring tools and resources such as content management systems (CMS), coding libraries and frameworks, and templates have fundamental impact on accessibility and are difficult to change later on. There may be other processes involved in the production of content for your website, for example, <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> or video creation. It is essential to review how well these resources and processes support accessibility and explore alternatives if necessary.</p>
				<p>There may also be design and coding guidelines, and early design resources such as personas, storyboards, mockups, and prototypes available. It is important to evaluate these for accessibility, as they will have impact on the entire design and development process.</p>
				<p>For websites under creation you may have access to resources from the design and development of similar websites within the organization, including accessibility assessments. Exploring similar external websites can also be useful.</p>

			</ul>

			<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>


			<h2 id="train">Assess Skills and Deliver Training</h2>
			<p>Identify the needs and plan for periodic training of all key personnel, including design, development, and content creation teams. Aim to continually enhance the motivation, skill levels, and overall capabilities across the project and organization. Consider what additional recruitment needs might be required and how recruitment might change to respond to your organizational policy.</p>

			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Assess expertise and motivation of key project personnel.</li>
				<li>Budget and plan general awareness raising and targeted skills building training for team members.</li>
				<li>Consider the potential need to recruit personnel with specific accessibility expertise.</li>
				<li>Include accessibility requirements as standard criteria in the recruitment process.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="f_panelHead">More detail</h3>
			<div>
				<p>The ability to create an accessible website is larger dependent on the skills and expertise of the team of designers, developers, and content creators. A frequent cause of accessibility barriers is simply the lack of awareness and skills.</p>
				<p class="eg">
					e.g.
				</p>
				<div class="example-bar">
					<h4>Example training sessions</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Benefits of accessible websites</strong> for management.</li>
						<li><strong>Introduction to accessibility</strong> for many departments, such as <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr></li>
						<li><strong>Visual design and accessibility</strong> for designers and marketing.</li>
						<li><strong>Accessible web development</strong> for programmers and developers.</li>
						<li><strong>Writing accessible content</strong> for non-technical content authors.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>Technical, design, and content creation staff will need to have both a good awareness of the need for accessible solutions and the technical expertise to deliver accessible solutions. Management can also benefit from training that builds an understanding of the need and value of accessibility. As with most skills, on-going training at regular intervals is needed to evolve the expertise and keep the knowledge up-to-date.</p>
				<p>In some cases targeted recruitment of personnel with particular expertise can help leverage the overall skills already within the team. Also including accessibility as part of the standard recruitment criteria helps build and maintain the overall skill level and capabilities across the organization.</p>

			<h2 id="project">Integrate into Project Life Cycle</h2>
			<p>Regardless of your development methodology integrate accessibility throughout the project from design to final user acceptance testing. This may by comprehensive evaluations at key milestones, or more light-weight reviews following each sprint. Start early in the process to reduce the risk of being constrained by early design decisions that become expensive to change later in the project. Promote accessibility within the team as a positive challenge to encourage creative thinking of accessible solutions.</p>

			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul class='key-actions'>
				<li><span class="f_panelHead">Start early and factor for iterative checks.</span>
					<div>
						<p>Starting early increases the positive impact for target audiences, reduces costs, and increases adoption of accessible design and coding features.</p>
						<p>For some issues there is no clear solution, running iterative checks allows teams to explore various solutions until an acceptable one is identified. Also, some barriers may only become apparent when other barriers have been removed. Doing this in the early stages of the project is likely to be the cheapest and easiest approach.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li><span class="f_panelHead">Evaluate all project design assets.</span>
					<div>
						<p>Design assets include resources such as visual design and interaction concepts, wireframes, and prototypes. Reviewing these can help identify barriers before significant coding work takes place. It may also be beneficial to review resources such as personas, user stories, and storyboards. Incorporating the needs of users with disabilities into these assets can help designers and developers understand barriers faced.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li><span class="f_panelHead">Run whole team accessibility solution reviews.</span>
					<div>
						<p>Having representatives from all teams involved in the project to review identified barriers helps create a shared understanding of solution constraints, such as organizational brand guidelines. For example, developers with accessibility experience can help your design team to explore the designs and how slight changes might help the accessibility of the final code.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li><span class="f_panelHead">Provide developer checklist of applicable criteria and relevant techniques.</span>
					<div>
						<p>A checklist of key accessibility points to review during development can help developers avoid introducing common problems. The checklist need not be exhaustive, but should aim to cover the most important points. It is important to ensure that the checklist does not become the 'standard' or a substitute for comprehensive evaluations. Also useful to developers is a checklist of important and relevant techniques to follow based on the technology being used. For example, a list of <a href="/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/html.html">all available HTML techniques</a>.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li><span class="f_panelHead">Evaluate throughout the project and ensure a comprehensive evaluation on completed website.</span>
					<div>
						<p>Plan evaluations for key milestones or sprints throughout the development process. Key pages or processes, and stand alone components can be evaluated as they become available. Aim to ensure that what has been created meets the standards outlined in your organizational policy.</p>
						<p>Evaluations should include input from users with disabilities. Encourage team members to attend testing sessions as this provides tremendous insight into barriers and helps team members identify with the problems caused.</p>
						<p>Identified barriers should be reviewed by key team members to identify suitable solutions which should then be fed into the next development cycle.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li><span class="f_panelHead">Plan for a reasonable gap between completion and go live to address any final barriers.</span>
					<div>
						<p>Running an accessibility evaluation in the last stages of a project will increase the risk that barriers are found and there is no time or budget to address them. Starting early and integrating the evaluations will reduce this risk. Even with an iterative evaluation approach it could be that barriers are only found when the complete site is tested. Plan for some final time before go live can reduce this risk.</p>
					</div>

			<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>


			<h2 id="share">Share Knowledge and Outcomes</h2>
			<p>Consider how the project success or difficulties need to be feed to stakeholders, the wider organization and the website audiences. Plan for ongoing issue tracking of website, organizational assets, such as design guidelines, and policies and procedures.</p>

			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Report to stakeholders the project accessibility successes and difficulties.</li>
				<li>Report design and technical achievements to other website teams.</li>
				<li>Create internal publicity for new website accessibility.</li>
				<li>Consider creating an organization wide accessibility monitoring and reporting framework.</li>
				<li>Consider how to capture and share information on new technologies and techniques.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="f_panelHead">More detail</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Communicating success is an important part of maintaining support for accessibility activities. Stakeholders and executives will require reports that respond to the driver for accessibility. Communicating to other managers, project teams, and departments the value of an accessibility with concrete examples can help change attitudes towards accessibility.</p>
				<p>Where your goal is associated with corporate social responsibility, internal <abbr title="Public Relations">PR</abbr> activities may be required. These should aim to cultivate a broad sense of the value of the work that your organization is undertaking.</p>
				<p>Sharing what is learned as part of a project is key to ongoing improvements in accessibility. Seek to provide a knowledge management platform to host best practice guidelines, technical techniques, policies, and procedures. Sharing helps avoid repeating problems and in spreading best practice solutions. As knowledge of accessibility percolates through your organization, having a known platform for communicating this information can be invaluable as teams will come to see it as a go-to resource when developing websites.</p>
			</div>

			<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>


			<h2 id="monitor">Maintain and Monitor</h2>
			<p>Plan for regular content reviews and ensure the accessibility policy is incorporated into maintenance activities. Provide an appropriate feedback mechanism for users with accessibility issues.</p>

			<h3>Key actions</h3>

				<p>Updates to content and website maintenance work may introduce accessibility barriers so it is important to plan for regular monitoring. Including accessibility checks as part of the <abbr title="Quality Assurance">QA</abbr> phase of your publication process is the most effective approach. This also help identify any regular issues that training can help address.</p>
				<p>Providing a clear and simple way for website users to raise any issues can also help your maintenance and monitoring efforts. Ensure that whoever is responsible for responding is appropriately trained and that there is a clear escalation process for identified barriers.</p>
				<p>Plan to review organizational policies and procedures, and update them based on how they supported accessible website creation or based on internal or external feedback. Policies and procedures will also benefit from regular reviews against new or updated legislation, standards or best practice.</p>
