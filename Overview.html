      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p id="intro-1">Incorporating accessibility into your project or organization is as straight forward as any other planning task. This document provides you with guidance, questions, and a framework for how to approach planning for accessibility. Your actual approach will vary depending the size of your organization, what you are aiming to achieve and where you are in the development process.</p>
      <p id="intro2">Additional guidance is available if you are looking at <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/improving.html">Improving the Accessibility of Your Website</a>.</p>
      <p id="intro-3">This document is for project managers, project team leaders, and small business owners. It will also benefit accessibility consultants who are engaged in supporting a project or broader organizational change.</p>
      <p id="intro-4">The following summarizes what this document presents. This does not suggest a fixed order and should be used however best suits your project and organization.</p>
      <ul id="intro-5">
         <li><a href="#goals" shape="rect">Determine Goal and Promote Buy-In</a> - identifies important themes to address regarding organizational awareness and buy-in for accessibility.</li>

      </ul>

      <p class="totop"><a href="#contents" shape="rect">back to page contents</a></p>    


      <h2 id="goal">Determine Goal and Promote Buy-In</h2>
      <p id="goal-1">Consider your organization's current approach, understanding and view of accessibility. Ensure buy-in from your organization to reduce the difficulty in securing budget and time. Undertake activities to convince stakeholders or executives of the value of an accessibility lead approach.</p>

      <h3 id="goal--actions">Key actions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Determine and document organizational or project driver for accessibility.</li>
        <li>Identify and document the project goal with regards to accessibility.</li>
        <li>Explore the limitations of your influence to enact change or extract budget.</li>
        <li>Ensure stakeholder buy-in for the goal.</li>
        <li>If required, prepare a business case to secure stakeholder backing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="goal--driver" class="f_panelHead">Driver for accessibility</h3>
      <div>
        <p id="goal--driver-1">Understanding why you or your organization are seeking to incorporate accessibility can be important when there are clashes in project or organizational priorities. It also helps you to identify activities important to the success of the project. For example, if senior management have indicated that all new websites must be accessible, then there is a need to ensure that the accessibility of the website is reported to them regularly. If you are responding to national legislation it may be beneficial to convince your project team and stakeholders that accessibility is something more than simply a legal burden or it may be appropriate to seek external validation to the websites accessibility claims.</p>
        <p id="goal--driver-2">The rationale for accessibility should be recorded as part of the broader project scope. This makes sure that everyone is clear why accessibility is important within this particular project. It also ensures that any further developments to the website include the same accessibility considerations.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="goal--identify-goal" class="f_panelHead">Identify your goal</h3>
      <div>
        <p id="goal--identify-goal-1">Knowing what you are aiming to achieve helps you make decisions about what activities are necessary and appropriate. It could be that you are seeking to bring about more accessibility thinking within all aspects of your organization. Perhaps you are a project manager seeking to understand what activities and questions are important to plan for when creating a new accessible web service. Or you may be part of a small organization seeking to ensure that the new website you are commissioning is as accessible as possible.</p>
        <p id="goal--identify-goal-2">For example, if you are seeking to bring about organizational change then there will be a need to plan broader activities such as reviewing purchasing procedures, recruitment criteria or training provision. If your goals is simply to create a WCAG 2.0 AA compliant site then it will be important to undertake and audit against these guidelines, possibly supported by accessibility testing.</p>
        <p id="goal--identify-goal-3">As with the driver for accessibility, the goal should be recorded in the project scope.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="goal--influence" class="f_panelHead">Organizational influence</h3>
      <div>
        <p id="goal--influence-1">What influence you have within your organization is a significant factor in what can be achieved. It may be that, while you as the project manager do not have significant capacity to influence change, you have the backing of senior management who see what you are doing as the first steps in organization wide improvement. In this case you will need to consider what upward reporting is required and how to manage project legacy, such as changes in organizational design guidelines, procurement process, or content management system recommendations.</p>
        <p id="goal--influence-2">It could also be that your organization has not yet embraced accessibility and you are keen to promote the value of such an approach. In this case activities such as setting out a business case to stakeholders will be of importance, particularly if there is a need to secure additional project funds.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="goal--buyin" class="f_panelHead">Promote Buy-In</h3>
      <div>
        <p id="goal--buyin-1">Stakeholder or executive buy-in is an extremely important part in achieving your aims. Required promotional activities will depend on your driver for accessibility and what influence you have with stakeholders. The ideal situation is that the driver is concrete and accepted, for example, national legislation, and the executive level of the organization is actively backing accessibility. In this case it may be sufficient to simply identify the necessary activities and incorporate within the project budget.</p>
        <p id="goal--buyin-2">More likely there are factors that will limit what can be done at the project level. In this case there may be a need to begin by creating a business case for accessibility and actively promoting this with stakeholders and/or executives. The aim is to encourage budget controllers to be responsive to extending project budget for accessibility related activities.</p>
        <p id="goal--buyin-3">Depending on your goal it may also be necessary to promote accessibility more broadly within the organization. This is particularly important where the goal is to affect change for subsequent projects. This may require presentations or information being made available to people or departments beyond the project team and stakeholders.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 id="resp">Establish Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
      <p id="resp-1">Identify and appoint individuals who are responsible for accessibility within your project team or organization, and outline what that role entails.</p>
    
      <h3 id="resp--actions">Key actions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify roles and assign responsibilities across different areas of the project, such as design, content creation, development, and quality assurance.</li>
        <li>Consider what organizational areas might impact on the accessibility of the project, such as human resources, procurement, marketing, organizational executive, legal, and ensure they are aware of their role and responsibilities.</li>
        <li>Communicate up and down within the project and organization who the responsible parties are.</li>
        <li>If you are using an external company or organization, ensure that they are aware of your accessibility requirements and of their responsibilities.</li>
        <li>For websites and projects spanning multiple jurisdictional regions, ensure that responsibility is assigned for each region.</li>
      </ul>


      <h3 id="resp--discuss" class="f_panelHead">Discussion</h3>
      <div>
        <div class="">
          <p id="resp--discuss-1">Identifying and appointing individuals responsible for accessibility is an important part of ensuring that accessibility is considered throughout the design and development process, and across the organization. The assigned roles ensure that any accessibility related issues are not neglected and that everyone on the team knows where to take accessibility questions.</p>

          <div class="aside">
            <h4 id="resp--discuss--examples">Example responsibilities</span></h4>
            <ul id="resp--discuss--examples-1">
              <li><b>Marketing</b> - Ensuring good accessibility practice within the brand or design guidelines.</li>
              <li><b>Quality assurance</b> - Test for and track accessibility issues within the code.</li>
              <li><b>Development</b> - Maintain code libraries with accessible components.</li>
              <li><b>Purchasing</b> - Ensure that organizational accessibility policy is incorporated within procurement processes.</li>
              <li><b>Acceptance testing</b> - Ensure that any agency delivered website or component meets your desired level of accessibility.</li>
              <li><b>Recruitment</b> - Incorporate accessibility skills within recruitment profiles.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p id="resp--discuss-2">Responsibility may be spread throughout your project team, particularly in larger teams. For example, the responsibility for ensuring accessible visual design may be shared by the design manager and digital designer. In other situations, one individual may have multiple responsibilities. For example, in a smaller team a developer may be responsible for the coding as well as for the quality assurance testing. What is important, is to identify the necessary responsibilities and assign them to appropriate individuals.</p>
          <p id="resp--discuss-3">While some roles and responsibilities are focused on the immediate project needs, others are focused on ensuring sustainability of the necessary frameworks that facilitate accessibility. For example, part of the responsibility of the role for 'accessible design' would be to ensure that members of the design team have the appropriate skills and knowledge to deliver accessible designs. Other areas that you may also need to consider include human resources, procurement, marketing, organizational executive, and legal. Identified responsible parties in these areas have the task of incorporating accessibility into existing policies, practices, and procedures.</p> 
          <p id="resp--discuss-4">For some organizations the task of creating a website, or part of it, such as the visual design, is often placed in the hands of an external company. In this case you, as the purchaser, will still hold responsibility for website accessibility. It is important to ensure that you are clearly communicating what you expect in terms of accessibility to the supplier.</p>
          <p id="resp--discuss-5">The following list provides examples of other functions that might be important to consider when assigning responsibility:</p>
          <ul id="resp--discuss-6">
            <li>Sign-off process and authority for accessibility of deliverables.</li>
            <li>Manage and procure accessibility audits and testing.</li>
            <li>Executive presentations of progress and business value of accessibility.</li>
            <li>Regular communication between regional and departmental accessibility teams.</li>
            <li>Ongoing review and sharing of new accessibility techniques.</li>
            <li>Identify and respond to accessibility training needs.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div style="clear: both"></div>

      <p class="totop"><a href="#contents" shape="rect">back to page contents</a></p>


      <h2 id="policy">Develop Accessibility Policy</h2>
      <p id="policy-1">Create or review your organizational or project accessibility policy. This should outline your commitment to accessibility, relevant standards or legislation, and contact information. There is likely to be an internal and external version of this document.</p>

      <h3 id="policy--actions">Key actions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify and review any existing policy.</li>
        <li>Establish an organizational policy on web accessibility.</li>
        <li>Communicate organizational policy.</li>
        <li>Review policies and procedures to incorporate organizational policy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="policy--discuss" class="f_panelHead">Discussion</h3>
      <div>
        <p id="policy--discuss-1">Your organizational policy captures and communicates your intentions to create accessible websites and services. <a href="pol.html">Developing Organizational Policies</a> provides information on how to develop your policy, this discussion concentrates on what the policy is for and what to do with it.</p>
        <p id="policy--discuss-2">An organizational policy may already exist or it may be that there is a general statement on website accessibility conformance. In larger organizations other departments, such as online development teams, corporate social responsibility, or user experience, may be developing or have developed accessibility policies. If such a policy exists it may be that it supports your accessibility goals or does not encompass everything you are hoping to achieve. In either case it is worth asking some questions. How is the policy implemented? Are there any issues implementing it? Is it up to date?</p>
        <p id="policy--discuss-3">Making people, both internal and external, aware of the existence of your policy is an important step in acknowledging your intent. Communication is also important for subsequent projects. The more the policy is promoted, the greater the awareness of it within your organization. For external audiences you may need a policy written in a non-technical way, without reference to internal departments or processes. Internal audiences will require more information regarding responsible parties, contacts, and on the technical elements of website accessibility. It may also be beneficial to provide a facility and policy for readers to feedback with compliments or concerns.</p>
        <p id="policy--discuss-4">Where your goals have an element of organizational change there will be a need to explore how the policy is incorporated into other organizational processes and procedures. For example, your procurement processes would outline how externally purchased websites or elements should meet your accessibility policy and what acceptance criteria are acceptable. Policy and procedural review can be an extensive activity that may form a project by itself.</p>

        <h4 id="policy--discuss--small">Smaller organizations</h4>
        <p id="policy--discuss-2">For smaller organizations the policy may be a simple statement of intent and reference to WCAG 2.0 as an appropriate international standard. Communicating this may only require publishing it on your website and ensuring the organization is aware of it. </p>

      <h2 id="resource">Review Available Tools and Resources</h2>
      <p id="resource-1">Identify and review what internal design and development resources are available and how they already support the project goals and accessibility policy. Resources could include design guidelines, templates, coding standards, coding libraries, content management systems, or content strategies. You may also be able to review other organizational sites to identify common accessible solutions or barriers.</p>

      <h2 id="train">Assess Skills and Training</h2>
      <p id="train-1">Assess expertise and motivation of design, development and content personnel. Identify and plan for training key personnel within the project or organization. Secure external training resources to create and/or deliver training options. Consider what additional recruitment needs might be required and how recruitment might change to respond to your organizational policy.</p>
      <p class="totop"><a href="#contents" shape="rect">back to page contents</a></p>


      <h2 id="project">Integrate into Project Life Cycle</h2>
      <p id="project-1">Start early. Review each stage of the project considering where and what accessibility checks could be incorporated. Continually promote accessibility as a positive challenge within the team to encourage creative thinking of accessible solutions.</p>
      <p class="totop"><a href="#contents" shape="rect">back to page contents</a></p>


      <h2 id="promte">Promote Organizational Awareness</h2>
      <p id="promote-1">Consider how the project success or difficulties need to be feed to stakeholders, the wider organization and the website audiences. Plan for ongoing issue tracking of website, organizational assets, such as design guidelines, and policies and procedures.</p>
      <p class="totop"><a href="#contents" shape="rect">back to page contents</a></p>


      <h2 id="monitor">Maintain and Monitor</h2>
