			<h2 id="intro" class="no-display">Introduction</h2>
			<p>Incorporating accessibility into your project or organization is as straight forward as any other planning task. This document provides you with guidance and considerations on how to approach planning for accessibility, whether that is for an individual website development project or across your entire organization. Your actual approach will vary depending the size of your organization, what you are aiming to achieve, and where you are in the development process.</p>
			<p>Additional guidance is available if you are looking at <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/improving.html">Improving the Accessibility of Your Website</a>.</p>
			<p>This document is for project managers, project team leaders, and small business owners. It is also useful for accessibility consultants who are engaged in supporting a project or broader organizational change.</p>
			<p>The following summarizes what this document presents. This does not suggest a fixed order and can be used however best suits your project and organization.</p>

			<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>		


			<h2 id="goal">Determine Your Goal and Gather Support</h2>
			<p>Establish a realistic goal given your organization's current approach, understanding, and view of accessibility. Undertake activities to gather support to achieve these goals and convince stakeholders or executives of their value.</p>

			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify and document the project goal with regards to accessibility.</li>
				<li>Explore your organization's current approach, understanding, and view of accessibility.</li>
				<li>Identify the key drivers for accessibility and, if needed, develop a business case.</li>
				<li>Promote awareness within your organization, and seek interested peers.</li>
				<li>Secure commitment and backing, ideally by the executive and project management level.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="f_panelHead">Discussion</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Your goal defines what you are aiming to achieve and helps you decide what actions are needed to obtain backing and define deliverables. For example, your goal might be to develop an accessible website as an individual project, to integrate accessibility throughout the organization to ensure the accessibility of your website, or merely to advocate for web accessibility within your organization.</p>
				<p>Exploring your organization's current approach, understanding, and view of accessibility is an important first step. In most cases you will need to promote and gather support for accessibility, especially if your organization has had little experience with accessibility so far. Determining the key drivers for accessibility is critical to this purpose.</p>
				<p>In some cases the drivers can be external, such as to meet legislation or to be more competitive. Drivers may also be internal such as to meet directives from senior management or to increase revenue by growing the website's reach to include people with disabilities, older people, and mobile web users.</p>
				<p>Developing a business case in response to your particular situation is often needed to convince your management and your colleagues, and to secure budget and time for accessibility activities. Obtaining and documenting commitment, ideally by more senior management, will simplify many issues down the line, especially when there are clashes in project or organizational priorities. Where you have limited influence within your organization, this backing will be invaluable.</p>

			</ul>

			<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>		


			<h2 id="resp">Establish Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
			<p>Identify and appoint individuals who are responsible for accessibility within your project team or organization, and outline what that role entails.</p>
		
			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify roles and assign responsibilities across different areas of the project, such as design, content creation, development, and quality assurance.</li>
				<li>Consider what organizational areas might impact on the accessibility of the project, such as human resources, procurement, marketing, organizational executive, legal, and ensure they are aware of their role and responsibilities.</li>
				<li>Communicate up and down within the project and organization who the responsible parties are.</li>
				<li>If you are using an external company or organization, ensure that they are aware of your accessibility requirements and of their responsibilities.</li>
				<li>For websites and projects spanning multiple jurisdictional regions, ensure that responsibility is assigned for each region.</li>
			</ul>


			<h3 class="f_panelHead">Discussion</h3>
			<div>
				<div class="">
					<p>Identifying and appointing individuals responsible for accessibility ensure that any accessibility related issues are not neglected and that everyone on the team, and in your organization, knows where to take accessibility questions.</p>

					<div class="aside">
						<p class="eg">
							e.g.
						</p>
						<div class="example-bar">
							<h4>Example responsibilities</h4>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Marketing</b> - Ensuring good accessibility practice within the brand or design guidelines.</li>
								<li><b>Development</b> - Maintain code libraries with accessible components.</li>
								<li><b>Purchasing</b> - Ensure that organizational accessibility policy is incorporated within procurement processes.</li>
								<li><b>Acceptance testing</b> - Ensure that any agency delivered website or component meets your desired level of accessibility.</li>
								<li><b>Recruitment</b> - Incorporate accessibility skills within recruitment profiles.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>

					<p>Responsibility may be spread throughout your project team, particularly in larger teams. For example, the responsibility for ensuring accessible visual design may be shared by the design manager and digital designer. In other situations, one individual may have multiple responsibilities. For example, in a smaller team a developer may be responsible for the coding as well as for the quality assurance testing. What is important, is to identify responsibilities and assign them to appropriate individuals.</p>
					<p>While some roles and responsibilities are focused on the immediate project needs, others are focused on ensuring sustainability of frameworks that facilitate accessibility. For example, part of the responsibility of the role for 'accessible design' would be to ensure that members of the design team have the appropriate skills and knowledge to deliver accessible designs. Other areas that you may also need to consider include human resources, procurement, marketing, organizational executive, and legal. Identified responsible parties in these areas have the task of incorporating accessibility into existing policies, practices, and procedures.</p>

			<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>


			<h2 id="policy">Develop and Implement Organizational Policy</h2>
			<p>Develop and maintain a policy that states your organization's commitment to web accessibility, and ensure that it is adhered to throughout the project and across the organization.</p>

			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify any existing policies related to accessibility.</li>
				<li>Establish a policy that states your organization's commitment to web accessibility.</li>
				<li>Communicate and promote the policy across relevant parts of the organization.</li>
				<li>Review existing policies and procedures to incorporate the policy throughout.</li>
				<li>Consider announcing your organization's commitments publicly for accountability.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="f_panelHead">Discussion</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Your organizational policy captures and communicates your intentions to provide accessible websites and services. Establishing an organizational policy for web accessibility is a critical milestone as it documents your organization's commitment to accessibility and helps set expectations for everyone involved.</p>
				<p>There may be existing policies and commitments relating to accessibility that you could build on. For example, there may be policies relating to work ethics, equal opportunities, diversity, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) that could be relevant.</p>
				<p>You can reflect the web accessibility policy in relevant policies to incorporate it throughout the organization's procedures and practices, and maximize its impact. For example, your procurement processes would outline how externally purchased websites or elements will meet your accessibility policy and what acceptance criteria are acceptable</p>
				<p>While the bulk of the web accessibility policy may be internal, it is often useful to outline your organization's commitments in a public policy to help set expectations of your website visitors and reaffirm public accountability internally.</p>

			<h2 id="resource">Review Available Tools and Resources</h2>
			<p>Identify and review what internal design and development tools and resources are available, and how well they can support you in meeting your accessibility goals.</p>

			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify web authoring tools and review how well they support your accessibility goals.</li>
				<li>Review resources such as design and coding guidelines, coding frameworks, code libraries, and templates.</li>
				<li>Review design resources including any personas, storyboards, mockups, and prototypes.</li>
				<li>Research lessons learned from the development of other websites within the organization.</li>
				<li>Explore examples of similar websites and organizations, and publicly documented solutions.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="f_panelHead">Discussion</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Web authoring tools and resources such as content management systems (CMS), coding libraries and frameworks, and templates have fundamental impact on accessibility and are difficult to change later on. There may be other processes involved in the production of content for your website, for example, <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> creation. It is essential to review how well these resources and processes support accessibility and explore alternatives if necessary.</p>
				<p>There may also be design and coding guidelines, and early design resources such as personas, storyboards, mockups, and prototypes available. It is important to evaluate these for accessibility, as they will have impact on the entire design and development process.</p>
				<p>For websites under creation you may have access to resources from the design and development of similar websites within the organization, including accessibility assessments. Exploring similar external websites can also be useful.</p>

			</ul>

			<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>


			<h2 id="train">Assess Skills and Deliver Training</h2>
			<p>Identify the needs and plan for periodic training of all key personnel, including design, development, and content creation teams. Aim to continually enhance the motivation, skill levels, and overall capabilities across the project and organization. Consider what additional recruitment needs might be required and how recruitment might change to respond to your organizational policy.</p>

			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Assess expertise and motivation of design, development, and content creation personnel.</li>
				<li>Budget and plan training for team members, and seek external services where needed.</li>
				<li>Balance training between general awareness raising and targeted skills building.</li>
				<li>Consider the potential need to recruit personnel with specific accessibility expertise.</li>
				<li>Include accessibility requirements as standard criteria in the recruitment process.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="f_panelHead">Discussion</h3>
			<div>
				<p>The ability to create an accessible website is larger dependent on the skills and expertise of the team of designers, developers, and content creators. A frequent cause of accessibility barriers is simply the lack of awareness and skills.</p>
				<div class="aside">
					<p class="eg">
						e.g.
					</p>
					<div class="example-bar">
						<h4>Example training sessions</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Benefits of accessible websites</strong> for management.</li>
							<li><strong>Introduction to accessibility</strong> for many departments, such as <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr></li>
							<li><strong>Visual design and accessibility</strong> for designers and marketing.</li>
							<li><strong>Accessible web development</strong> for programmers and developers.</li>
							<li><strong>Writing accessible content</strong> for non-technical content authors.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>Technical, design, and content creation staff will need to have both a good awareness of the need for accessible solutions and the technical expertise to deliver accessible solutions. Management can also benefit from training that builds an understanding of the need and value of accessibility. As with most skills, on-going training at regular intervals is needed to evolve the expertise and keep the knowledge up-to-date.</p>
				<p>In some cases targeted recruitment of personnel with particular expertise can help leverage the overall skills already within the team. Also including accessibility as part of the standard recruitment criteria helps build and maintain the overall skill level and capabilities across the organization.</p>

			</ul>

			<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>


			<h2 id="project">Integrate into Project Life Cycle</h2>
			<p>Start early. Review each stage of the design and development process considering where and what accessibility requirements need to be incorporated. Continually promote accessibility as a positive challenge within the team to encourage creative thinking of accessible solutions.</p>

			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Start early and factor for iterative checks.</li>
				<li>Evaluate all design assets.</li>
				<li>Run whole team accessibility solution reviews.</li>
				<li>Provide developer checklist of applicable criteria and relevant techniques.</li>
				<li>Perform a comprehensive evaluation and testing of the complete website.</li>
				<li>Plan for a reasonable gap between completion and go live to address any final barriers.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="f_panelHead">Discussion</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Starting early with accessibility increases the positive impact your work will have for target audiences, reduces the associated costs, and increases the adoption of accessible design and coding features. To ensure success, accessibility needs to be considered throughout the entire design and development process, including the initial conception stages of a website.</p>
				<p>Carrying out iterative accessibility checks at each stage helps identify potential issues early that are more difficult to address later on. For example, the selection of color combinations and fonts, web authoring tools such as the <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>, and interaction and design concepts during the earlier stages of a project. If there are accessibility barriers in any of these components they are usually extremely difficult to change in later stages.</p>
				<p>Any early stage reviews should be ideally be carried out with the whole team. This allows designers, developers, and content creators to understand the goals and limitations of each team. Understanding this can help everyone create more accessible solutions to any identified barriers.</p>
				<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/involving">Involving users with disabilities</a> during iterative stages can help you better understand the issues and make more informed design decisions. This reduces the overall effort needed to create an accessible website. Involving users can also help make accessibility more tangible and real for project members. This is particularly important for management and any external organizations, such as a marketing agency, as they may be quite removed from the issues.</p>

			</ul>

			<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>


			<h2 id="share">Share Knowledge and Outcomes</h2>
			<p>Consider how the project success or difficulties need to be feed to stakeholders, the wider organization and the website audiences. Plan for ongoing issue tracking of website, organizational assets, such as design guidelines, and policies and procedures.</p>

			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Report to stakeholders the project accessibility successes and difficulties.</li>
				<li>Report design and technical achievements to other website teams.</li>
				<li>Create internal publicity for new website accessibility.</li>
				<li>If considering the whole organization, create a monitoring and reporting framework.</li>
				<li>Consider how to capture and share information on new technologies and techniques.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="f_panelHead">Discussion</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Communicating success is an important part of maintaining support for accessibility activities. Stakeholders and executives will require reports that respond to the driver for accessibility. Communicating to other managers, project teams, and departments the value of an accessibility with concrete examples can help change attitudes towards accessibility.</p>
				<p>Where your goal is associated with corporate social responsibility, internal <abbr title="Public Relations">PR</abbr> activities may be required. These should aim to cultivate a broad sense of the value of the work that your organization is undertaking.</p>
				<p>Sharing what is learned as part of a project is key to ongoing improvements in accessibility. Seek to provide a knowledge management platform to host best practice guidelines, technical techniques, policies, and procedures. Sharing helps avoid repeating problems and in spreading best practice solutions. As knowledge of accessibility percolates through your organization, having a known platform for communicating this information can be invaluable as teams will come to see it as a go-to resource when developing websites.</p>

			<h2 id="monitor">Maintain and Monitor</h2>
			<p>Plan for regular content reviews and ensure the accessibility policy is incorporated into maintenance activities. Provide an appropriate feedback mechanism for users with accessibility issues.</p>

			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Create a plan for regular checks and audits.</li>
				<li>Review and update publication process to include accessibility checks.</li>
				<li>Implement a feedback process for accessibility issues.</li>
				<li>Schedule regular reviews and updates of policies and processes.</li>
				<li>Plan for reviews of organizational assets related to website creation.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="f_panelHead">Discussion</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Updates to content and website maintenance work may introduce accessibility barriers so it is important to plan for regular monitoring. Including accessibility checks as part of the <abbr title="Quality Assurance">QA</abbr> phase of your publication process is the most effective approach. This also help identify any regular issues that training can help address.</p>
				<p>Providing a clear and simple way for website users to raise any issues can also help your maintenance and monitoring efforts. Ensure that whoever is responsible for responding is appropriately trained and that there is a clear escalation process for identified barriers.</p>
				<p>Plan to review organizational policies and procedures, and update them based on how they supported accessible website creation or based on internal or external feedback. Policies and procedures will also benefit from regular reviews against new or updated legislation, standards or best practice.</p>
