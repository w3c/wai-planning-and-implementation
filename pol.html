		<h2><a name="intro" id="intro" class="no-display">Introduction</a></h2>

		<p>Whether it is simple, or comprehensive your organizational policy captures your aims in creating accessible online resources.</p>
		 
		<p>This document addresses considerations that can arise when developing organizational policies on web accessibility.</p>

		<p>Organizational policies can be very simple, or very comprehensive.</p>

		<p>Since there are <a href="/WAI/Policy/">existing governmental policies</a>
		which apply to some kinds of websites in some countries, organizations
		should ensure that their policies at least require the minimum accessibility
		mandated by any policies which already apply to their sites.</p>

		<p>The following sections address considerations in setting organizational
		policy in more detail.</p>

		<h2><a name="refer" id="refer">Reference guidelines clearly</a></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The term "WAI Guidelines" is non-specific, as it can refer to any one
				of the three accessibility guidelines produced by W3C WAI. Provide a
				clear reference to the specific guidelines document with which
				conformance is expected: 
				<ul>
					<li>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<a href="/WAI/intro/wcag">WCAG</a>) is the
						W3C WAI specification which explains how to make websites
					accessible.</li>
					<li>Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (<a href="/WAI/intro/atag">ATAG</a>) is the
						W3C WAI specification which explains how to make software better
						support the production of accessible web content.</li>
					<li>User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (<a href="/WAI/intro/uaag">UAAG</a>) is the
						specification which explains how to make accessible browsers and
						multimedia players.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Organizations wishing to require conformance to the latest version of the standards may specify conformance	without specifying a version number.</li>
			<li>See <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/linking.html">Referencing and Linking to WAI Guidelines and Technical Documents</a> for more information.<br clear="none" />
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a name="confm" id="confm">Specify conformance level</a></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Specify an expected level of conformance for website(s). For example: 
				<ul>
					<li>"Conformance to WCAG 2.0, Level" sets the expectation that a website would fulfill all Level A success criteria, which address
						absolute barriers to accessing content on a website.</li>
					<li>"Conformance to WCAG 2.0, Level AA" sets the expectation that a website would fulfill all Level A and Level AA success criteria,
						which address absolute and substantial barriers to accessing content
						on a website.</li>
					<li>"Conformance to WCAG 2.0, Level AAA" sets the expectation that a website would fulfill all Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA success criteria,
						which address absolute, substantial, and minor barriers to accessing
						content on a website.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Specify an expected level of conformance for authoring tools used by
				the organization, or by third party developers, to produce content for
				the organization's website. 
				<ul>
					<li>"Conformance to ATAG [version number], Level A" sets the expectation that web
						authoring software acquired by an organization can fulfill all
						Level A success criteria for accessibility of the software user
						interface and support for production of accessible content. [See
						example under "#5 Set milestones" below.]</li>
					<li>[To add to terms of subcontract]: "[Subcontracted web developer]
						will consider the use of ATAG	[version number]-conformant software where
						available. If not using ATAG-conformant authoring tools,
						[subcontracted web developer] will ensure that all content and
						templates generated for [this organization's] production of content
						is WCAG 2.0, Level AA-conformant, and contains no markup that will
						interfere with generation of WCAG-conformant content.</li>
					<li>See "<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/software.html">Selecting
						and Using Authoring Tools for Web Accessibility</a>" for additional
						detail.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a name="scope" id="scope">Define scope of website(s)</a></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Specify to what extent this organization's requirements should apply to
				new, updated, and existing web pages. For example: 
				<ul>
					<li>"This policy applies to all new, updated, and existing web
					pages."</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Specify to what extent requirements should apply to web pages provided
				by a third-party (subcontractor, or other information provider, but as
				part of main site). The website's users may need access to primary and
				to third-party content equally. It may take additional effort to educate
				and get compliance from third-party content developers. For example: 
				<ul>
					<li>"This policy applies to all web content produced or updated by
						[this organization]. In addition, [this organization] is taking the
						following steps to ensure accessibility of content provided by
						third-party developers [NOTE that for some sites, accessibility of
						third-party content may be essential to complying with government
						policy]: 
						<ul>
							<li>informing third-party developers of [this organization's]
								policy on web accessibility;</li>
							<li>providing links to information and resources on implementing
								web accessibility;</li>
							<li>providing the following incentives to providers of WCAG 2.0 Level AA-conformant content...;</li>
							<li>monitoring and providing feedback on inaccessible third-party
								content;</li>
							<li>seeking alternative third-party content providers where
								original providers continue to provide non-conformant
							content.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a name="miles" id="miles">Set milestones</a></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Set a date by which the organizations website(s) will meet a given
				conformance level. For example: 
				<ul>
					<li>"By [date] [this organization's] websites will meet WCAG 2.0, Level AA conformance."</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>In some cases it may be practical to phase in accessibility by
				addressing all of level A success criteria rapidly, since these can be
				absolute barriers if not addressed; then phasing in level AA success criteria with the next round of site improvements [no later than a
				specified date]; with level AAA success criteria left as optional. For
				example: 
				<ul>
					<li>"By [first date] [this organization's] websites will meet WCAG 2.0, Level A conformance; and by [second date] [this organization's]
						websites will meet WCAG 2.0, Level AA conformance."</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Consider how to address questions of priorities that may arise
				especially for websites with a large number of pages. Do not make
				assumptions about which areas of a website or which web services people
				with disabilities are interested in or not. For example: 
				<ul>
					<li>"This policy applies to all areas of this organization's internal
						and external websites, including legacy content."</li>
					<li>Or, "This policy applies to all areas of this organization's
						internal and external websites, with priority to [specify which
						areas] areas of the site; however, all areas of the site are expected
						to conform to [specify conformance level] by [second date].</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Consider setting date(s) for accessibility support in software. For
				example:	
				<ul>
					<li>"By [first date], all vendors of authoring tools used by [this
						company] should provide information regarding their plans for ATAG [version number] conformance in future versions of their software. By [second
						date] [this company] will preferentially purchase ATAG-conformant
						authoring tools."</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Consider setting dates for browser and multimedia conformance, without
				restricting people's ability to use adaptive browsers. 
				<ul>
					<li>"By [date], all vendors of browsers and multimedia players used by
						[this company] should provide information regarding their plans for
						UAAG [version number] conformance in future versions of their software. By [second
						date] [this company] will preferentially purchase UAAG-conformant
						browsers and multimedia players. <br clear="none" />
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Consider setting dates for establishing internal resources for
				training, technical assistance, monitoring, and/or an internal web page
				with links to such resources.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a name="monit" id="monit">Define monitoring, conformance claims, and
		follow-up process</a></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Specify a recommended process and schedule for reviewing the
				organization's website for accessibility. For example: 
				<ul>
					<li>"Each department will review all areas of the organizations' website under its control using the process described at <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/">Evaluating Web Sites for
						Accessibility</a>, and will review all new material that it publishes
						by using the same process."</li>
					<li>Each section of the website will include links for feedback on the
						site; this information will be compiled and considered during the
						review process."</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Specify whether or not conformant pages, or sections of a website,
				should be labeled as such. For example: 
				<ul>
					<li>"The introductory page for sections of the website that have been
						determined to be conformant according to [link] process should
						display the [WCAG 2.0 Level	A logo] or bear the following statement
						["this page conforms to..."]</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Consider specifying a periodic review of areas of the website by an
				internal department with the authority to follow up on non-conformant
				areas of the website. For example: 
				<ul>
					<li>"[This organization] will conduct periodic reviews of the website
						and any department with non-conforming web pages will be asked to
						correct the problem within two weeks. Further problems in
						accessibility of an area will result in [specify as appropriate]"</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a name="integ" id="integ">Provide for integration and updating of
		policy</a></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>If the organization has or is developing an overall policy for websites, for instance establishing best practices for use of web standards,
				support for a privacy policy, internationalization, use of metadata,
				usability, etc., it can be useful to incorporate accessibility in the
				overall policy, rather than to establish accessibility as a stand-alone
				policy.</li>
			<li>Organizations referencing a specific version number, such as ATAG 1.0,	may want to incorporate mechanisms
				to review and update, or to automatically update, their policies when the next version in finalized as a W3C Recommendation.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2><a name="examples" id="examples">Example policies</a></h2>
		<h3>Example of simple policy:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>"[This organization] is committed to ensuring accessibility of its website for people with disabilities. All the pages on our website will
				conform to W3C WAI's <a href="/TR/WCAG/">Web Content Accessibility
				Guidelines</a> 2.0, Level AA conformance."</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Example of comprehensive policy:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>"[This organization] is committed to ensuring accessibility of its website for people with disabilities. New and updated web content produced
				by our organization will conform to W3C WAI's <a href="/TR/WCAG/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> 2.0, Level A conformance, by [date].
				Existing web content produced by our organization, and new, updated, and
				existing web content provided for our site by third-party developers,
				will conform to Level AA conformance by [date]. We will initiate an
				internal monitoring program by [date]. Vendors supplying software used to
				develop our site will be required to provide information by [date] on
				conformance to W3C WAI's <a href="/TR/ATAG/">Authoring Tool
				Accessibility Guidelines</a> [latest version], Conformance Level A. Our home page and
				our 'about this site' page will include links to this policy. We will
				review this policy in the future to consider updating it to	reference later
				versions of W3C's accessibility guidelines."</li>
