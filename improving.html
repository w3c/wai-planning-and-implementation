				<h2 id="intro" class="no-display">Introduction</h2>
				<p>Websites are made accessible to people with disabilities most efficiently and effectively when accessibility is considered early and throughout a project and organization. Guidance for addressing accessibility broadly throughout a program long-term is available in <a href="Overview">Planning and Managing Web Accessibility</a>.</p>
				<p><strong>If you need to fix accessibility barriers on an existing website now,</strong> this document is for you. It provides guidance to help you:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#target">Set your target</a></li>
					<li><a href="#scope">Clarify the scope</a></li>
					<li><a href="#assess">Assess the situation</a></li>
					<li><a href="#prioritize">Prioritize solutions</a></li>
					<li><a href="#repair">Implement repairs</a></li>
				</ul>


				<h2 id="target">Set your target</h2>
				<p>Your target is the accessibility standard you aim to evaluate against and conform to. The initial pressures for your project will likely influence your target.</p>
				<p>For example, if customer feedback highlighted an accessibility barrier that prevents use, then you probably want to fix that first. Similarly, if you are legally required to meet a certain level of accessibility, then your target will be at least that level.</p>
				<p>In some situations, you may define a multi-tiered target with different dates for different levels: For example, meet WCAG 2.0 Level A success criteria in key web pages within 6 months, and meet Level AA success criteria in all pages within 12 months.</p>

				<h3>Key actions</h3>
				<ul class="key-actions">
					<li><strong>Set a standard and conformance level.</strong>
						<p>Many organizations use <a href="/WAI/intro/wcag.php">WCAG</a> as a target for accessibility and specify conformance levels for each success criteria. Level A is the minimum level of three conformance levels. Most aim to achieve Level AA for success criteria. Your organization may already have an accessibility policy specifying what standard and level you need to achieve.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				
				
				<h2 id="scope">Clarify the scope</h2>
				<p>Scope is the range of web content you are aiming to review and improve. This could be a complete website, a mobile web application, or a subsection of pages. As with your compliance target, the scope of the work may be dictated by feedback from users or by other external factors.</p>
				<p>Even with restricted scope you might take the opportunity to fix other issues in related areas of the website. For example, while fixing contrast in the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> you might also fix other issues that only require changes to the CSS.</p>

				<h3>Key actions</h3>
				<ul class="key-actions">
					<li><strong>Review user feedback for accessibility issues.</strong>
						<p>Consider whether user feedback has identified any areas of your website where the accessibility could be improved. You might consider prioritizing these areas and communicating improvements on completion to the users who raised the concern.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Consider available resources.</strong>
						<p>You will need to carefully consider your timelines and available resources when determining the scope. Where you initially have limited resources, focusing on key user journeys and content often bring the most significant benefits in the shortest time.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Related resources</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a> &ndash; Explains how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities.</li>

				</ul>

			  <h2 id="assess">Assess the situation</h2>
				<p>The goal of assessing your website is to identify accessibility barriers and gather information to plan for their repair. Your target will define what you need to evaluate against, although it is sometimes worth evaluating to a higher level. There are likely some higher level criteria that you already meet or are easily achieved.</p>
				<p>Rather than thoroughly evaluating every target page, you can focus on shared areas or components in order to obtain more valuable information with less effort. For example, templates, style sheets, and any repeated items, such as navigation bars and footers, only need to be evaluated once.</p>
				<p>Many organizations hire accessibility specialists to evaluate their website. They will also be able to provide guidance on how to respond to the identified barriers. This can include general recommendations on approach and priorities, specific recommendations on solutions, and guidance on the knowledge and skills needed for the repairs.</p>

				<h3>Key actions</h3>
				<ul class="key-actions">
					<li><strong>Before assessing, fix any known barriers.</strong>
						<p>In some cases you may already know of accessibility barriers. If easily fixed, it may be best to repair these before going further. This can bring early site improvement. More importantly, if you are involving users in your evaluation, any existing barriers may make it difficult for them to access other areas or content. If known barriers can be fixed, this may help your users find other issues.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Evaluate using a standardized approach.</strong>
						<p>Ensure that you are consistent in applying your evaluation methodology. This allows you to repeat the evaluation and compare the results. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/"><abbr title="Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology">WCAG-EM</abbr></a> is a comprehensive and structured approach to help determine how well a website conforms to WCAG.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Use appropriate evaluation and repair tools.</strong>
						<p>Web accessibility evaluation tools are programs and online services that help check if a website meets accessibility guidelines. There are also tools that help repair accessibility barriers. Some evaluation tools can be configured to be more useful to your specific project. For example, once you figure out your scope and target, you can configure the tool to only evaluate those criteria and pages. This can speed up the evaluation and simplify the report.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Evaluate with real users.</strong>
						<p>If possible, evaluate with users to help your team understand the real-world impact of accessibility issues. An understanding of the effect of accessibility barriers helps in creating better solutions. Observing sessions where users wrestle with your site can also be a powerful motivator for your project team.</p>

			  <h2 id="prioritize">Prioritize solutions</h2>
				<p>When faced with limited resources or a need to respond quickly to issues, you will need to prioritize your repairs. There are two important factors to determine:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>What is the impact on people with disabilities?</strong>
						<p>While WCAG Success Criteria are the best measure of overall accessibility barriers, human experience and judgement are important to determining the impact of the issue. Assigning barriers with a WCAG Level A, AA, or AAA indicates the general impact. The actual impact depends on the context of the barrier and the target audience. For example, poor contrast in the main content has a high impact, whereas in generic footers it will be lower. Involving users with disabilities and accessibility specialists can help in determining how significant the barrier is.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>What is the effort required for repair?</strong>
						<p>The time, cost, and skills required to fix an issue will vary greatly. For example, repairing an issue in the header could require a simple change to a template that is automatically propagated throughout the website, or it could require changing every page manually.</p>
						<p>Discussion with representatives from all teams can help you quickly determine possible solutions and what effort would be required to implement them. Ensure that whoever is responsible for implementing the solution is involved, as they will know best what constraints exist.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Key actions</h3>
				<ul class="key-actions">
					<li><strong>Prioritize high impact, easily addressed barriers.</strong>
						<p>This provides the most improvement in the shortest time. Creating a graph of impact versus effort can help you quickly determine high priority barriers. This approach usually takes less time. However, it may result in harder-to-fix or low impact issues always falling out of scope.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Prioritize by important functionality or high use content.</strong>
						<p>It is usually best to first repair those areas that have the greatest impact on user experience. Identify key pages or journeys within the website and fix problems in those areas. For example, the home page may be a primary entry point, or purchasing a product and payment process may be important functions. Frequently-used, high-traffic pages and functionality can be identified using analytics.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Related resources</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="/WAI/intro/people-use-web/Overview">How People with Disabilities Use the Web</a> &ndash; Provides examples of how people with disabilities use the web, which can be helpful when prioritizing issues.</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>		


			  <h2 id="repair">Implement repairs</h2>
				<p>Once issues are prioritized, you will be better able to plan how long it will take to fix them based on the estimated effort. This gives a clear indication of what is achievable given the project resources available.</p>

				<h3>Key actions</h3>
				<ul class="key-actions">
					<li><strong>Distribute tasks throughout your team.</strong>
						<p>The brunt of repairs often falls to developers to address, but some issues, such as content or issues with process, will be better handled by others. For example, if text in primary content is not linked clearly then whoever manages your content can address this. For each issue to be fixed, ensure that it is clear who does the work and that they have the appropriate skills or knowledge.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Communicate requirements to those responsible for delivery.</strong>
						<p>Ensure that those who have been given responsibility for each task are aware of the specific requirements they need to meet. This may be a subset of the target standards for your organization. Encourage implementors to understand the requirement and why it is important so that solutions best address the issue.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Validate solutions as early as possible.</strong>
						<p>Sometimes there is no perfect solution or a solution might introduce other problems. Evaluate the repairs to ensure that the issue has been adequately addressed. If possible, seek to validate the solution at the earlierst opportunity to avoid the cost of implementing something that may not adequately address the issue.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Engage external experience and knowledge.</strong>
						<p> It is often best to combine educating existing staff with bringing in outside expertise, either hiring additional staff or engaging consultants. An accessibility specialist can save time and effort in the long run by providing:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The latest best practices for accessibility solutions.</li>
							<li>First-hand experience of how people with disabilities interact with the Web.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>		


			  <h2 id="strategic">Long term: Strategic planning</h2>
				<p>Thinking about accessibility tactically will generally be less cost effective and efficient than considering it as an integral part of your web development strategy. There are several things you can do to help your organization create more accessible websites as standard.</p>

				<h3>Key actions</h3>
				<ul class="key-actions">
					<li><strong>Consider accessibility as an organizational strategic goal.</strong>
						<p>Ensure that when redesigns or updates are planned, accessibility is included from the start of the project. Accessibility is much less costly and time-consuming when tackled at the beginning of a project, rather than the end.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Develop an organizational policy on accessibility.</strong>
						<p>An organizational policy on web accessibility defines your goals for how your organization will support the creation of accessible web content and services.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
